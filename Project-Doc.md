### Phase 3: Real-Time Features & Deployment

**Duration:** 4-5 weeks

**Objectives:**

- Implement real-time voice-to-text summarization.
- Develop an interactive chatbot assistant.
- Prepare the application for deployment.

**Tasks:**

1. **Real-Time Voice-to-Text Summarization:**

   - Integrate Gemini 2.0's audio processing capabilities via LangChain to allow users to input voice notes, which the AI will transcribe and summarize.

2. **Interactive Chatbot Assistant:**

   - Develop a chatbot powered by Gemini 2.0 that can answer user queries based on uploaded content, providing a conversational learning experience.

3. **Deployment & Scalability:**
   - Deploy the frontend on Vercel and the backend on a scalable platform.
   - Ensure the application is secure, optimized for performance, and capable of handling increased user load.

**Deliverable:** A fully operational, AI-driven smart notes application with real-time features, ready for user engagement.

## Leveraging Gemini 2.0's Extended Context Window

**Objective:** Utilize Gemini 2.0's 1 million token context window to maintain a comprehensive memory of all uploaded documents, enabling contextually aware interactions.

**Implementation:**

- **Centralized Document Repository:** Store all user-uploaded documents in Supabase, allowing the AI to access and reference previous content during interactions.

- **Dynamic Context Management:** Develop mechanisms to retrieve and compile relevant excerpts from stored documents based on user queries, ensuring the context stays within the token limit.

- **Session-Based Memory:** Maintain context across user sessions to provide continuity in interactions, enhancing personalization and relevance.

- **Context Caching for Efficiency:** Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed contexts to optimize performance and reduce latency.

- **User Interface Enhancements:** Provide users with transparency and control over the documents and context used during interactions, including features like document dashboards and context previews.

- **Privacy and Security Measures:** Ensure robust data encryption, access controls, and compliance with relevant regulations to protect user data.

By integrating these strategies, the application will offer a seamless and intelligent user experience, effectively utilizing Gemini 2.0's capabilities to manage and reference extensive amounts of information.
